			<p>This is the most important page on your website.  It is a page specifically designed to turn vistors of your website into visitors of your church.  The page has two goals:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Present a case for how your church can help the potential visitor.</li>
				<li>Present information a potential visitor would need to visit your church.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Watch the video here to find out about how to setup the welcome page.</p>
